vim-syntastic
=============

vim-syntastic debian stable packages

These are simple packages, made by "apt-get source vim-syntastic" from the testing repositories, 
and then built against a stable environment. 

While this is quite trivial, this repository exists for easy distribution of the resulting .deb 
packages.
